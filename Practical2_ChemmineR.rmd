## ChemmineR: Cheminformatics toolkit for R
Documentation for ChemmineR can be found here: 
<https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ChemmineR/inst/doc/ChemmineR.html>
This practical demonstrates a few basic functions and essentially repeats some of the exercises in the OpenBabel practical.

The directories for this practical are organised as follows:
- src : contains this markdown file
- data: contains any external input files
- output: contains the files written out by this script

### Installation and loading of the package (you only need to install once in a session)
**NOTE:** You do not need to install ChemmineR, if you are working on thoth with R version 4.0.1. It is already installed there.
```{r ChemmmineR installation}
# In the past I managed to run this tutorial without OpenBabel installed 
# on the system. This no longer seems to work. Follow installation 
# instructions here: http://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Installation
# and then install the ChemmineOB libray to allow access to the openbabel
# functions

# Remove the comments from the next couple of lines to install ChemmineOB and ChemmineR
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#    install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install("ChemmineOB")
library("ChemmineOB")
# BiocManager::install("ChemmineR")
# Once installed, the package needs to be loaded 
library("ChemmineR")

# To get a list of all functions available, do:
library(help="ChemmineR")

# We will also use the fmcSR package for finding maximum common substructures
# BiocManager::install("fmcsR", version = "3.8")
library("fmcsR")

```

### Format intercoversion and property calculation
First, we will simply transform a SMILES string into an SDFset object and then write that object to a file.

```{r format_interconversion}
smi_string <- "CCCc1nn(C)c2C(=O)NC(=Nc12)c3cc(ccc3OCC)[S](=O)(=O)N4CCN(C)CC4"
# The format conversion function requires that the vector of smiles has names (otherwise it fails)
names(smi_string) <- c("viagra")
# We can turn the SMILES string into an SDF-formatted file using smiles2sdf
# Remember that SDF is similar to the MDL mol format but allows for additional information to 
# be appended at the end of atom connection table.
sdf <- smiles2sdf(smi_string)
view(sdf) #check it worked and note that the datablock is empty as we did not append any information.
class(sdf) #sdf is of type SDFset
#check out the "slots" of sdf
header(sdf)
#or you can access a slot like this (note that you need to access first the first
#element of this list of SDF objects before you can access the slot header):
sdf[[1]]@header
#note that the header itself is a vector of strings
sdf[[1]]@header[1]
#or use the name of the vector elements
sdf[[1]]@header['Molecule_Name']
#atomblock and bondblock slots are both matrices of numbers
is.matrix(bondblock(sdf[[1]]))
dim(bondblock(sdf[[1]]))

write.SDF(sdf[[1]], file="output/viagra.sdf") 

# If ChemmineOB has been installed and loaded successfully, many open babel
# functions can be used
# EXAMPLE 1: generate 3D coordinates
sdf3D <- generate3DCoords(sdf)
view(sdf3D)
# Check the difference between the initial coordinates block in sdf and the current one in sdf3D (third column is the z coordinate)
atomblock(sdf[[1]])[,3]
atomblock(sdf3D[[1]])[,3]

write.SDF(sdf3D[[1]], file="output/viagra3D.sdf") 
# (if you want to see the result in proper 3D, open it in Chimera)

# EXAMPLE 2: calculate a small subset of properties
# a description of properties can be found on the open babel website:
# http://openbabel.org/wiki/Obprop
props <- propOB(sdf)
# (the result is a data frame with some basic properties calculated including
# an InChI code and logP)
is.data.frame(props)
# check what we calculated
colnames(props)
#MR = molecular refractivity (a measure of polarizability)
#nF = number of Fluorine atoms
#more descriptors here: 
#https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Descriptors/descriptors.html
props$logP
props$InChI

```

Next, we will do some basic analysis of the docked poses of ligands that we
used in the open babel tutorial.

```{r load_sdf_and_calculate_properties}
# 
# Read in the sdf file with all docked poses into an SDFset type object
# Note: if this file is not in your current working directory, you need
# to provide the full path to it
sdfset <- read.SDFset("data/1equ_ligonly_edited.sdf")

# Check how many SDF objects(molecules) are in this set
length(sdfset)

# SDF files differ from mol files in that they contain a number of 
# properties encoded with tags at the end of the entry (after the atoms
# and bonds blocks)
# View the first entry (first molecule in the file) and check its class
sdfset[[1]]
class(sdfset[[1]])

# View the properties of the first molecule (this is block 4 in the SDF object)
# these properties were produced by the docking program
sdfset[[1]][[4]]
#the same list of properties can be obtained with a function called datablock:
datablock(sdfset[[1]])
#the data block is a vector of named entries, so each one can be accessed by its name, e.g. to get the glide docking score do:
datablock(sdfset[[1]])["r_i_glide_gscore"]

# we can access the info for each molecule just like we did before
# for example, to get the ids, we need the Molecule_Name from the header
header(sdfset[[1]])['Molecule_Name']
# But the header function returns a list so we can't just do:
# header(sdfset[1:5])['Molecule_Name']
# instead you need to use something like sapply (see below)

# Fortunately, ChemmineR has also functions that operate on the SDFs of an SDFset, e.g.
# View the compound ids as stored in the Molecule Name field in the header of the sdf file - below we show the top 5 only (these were compounds from
# KEGG so they all start with "C" and are followed by 5 numbers)
sdfid(sdfset[1:5])

# The function MW calculates molecular weights for the molecules
MW(sdfset[1:5], addH=FALSE)
# We can calculate the MW for all compounds and plot a histogram of the
#distribution
hist(MW(sdfset, addH=FALSE))

# There are a number of functions to carry out basic calculations on SDFset
# objects. Below, we demonstrate atom counting, followed by visualisation
# of the distribution of different atom types in this set
# The function atomcountMA will return a matrix of the results where the
# the rows are the compounds and columns are the atom types being counted.
propma <- atomcountMA(sdfset, addH=FALSE)
boxplot(propma, main="Atom Frequency")

# Below we will extract the docking score for each compound and check
# whether it correlates with molecular weight (as it often does in docking
# programs)

# The datablock function returns a list of all data blocks and we want
# to extract only the "r_i_docking_score" entry from each data block
# The sapply function will return a vector of the docking scores
ds<- as.numeric(sapply(datablock(sdfset), '[[', "r_i_docking_score"))
# check we got all of them (length should be 800)
length(ds)
# we can also assign the proper molecule names to this vector
names(ds) <- sdfid(sdfset)
# check it worked
ds[1:3]
# now we will plot docking scores vs molecular weights
mw <- MW(sdfset, addH=FALSE)
plot(mw, ds, xlab="molecular weight", ylab="docking score")
# do a correlation test
cor.test(mw, ds)  #there is very little correlation, as suggested by the plot 

#
```

### Substructure searching
ChemmineR uses the package fmcsR to carry out maximum common substructure
searches. It can also use open babel's functionality to do SMARTS searches.

```{r MCS_search}
library(fmcsR) 

# We will look for a steroid skeleton using a SMARTS search
# (you can visualise the SMILES below using an online translator such as:
# http://www.openmolecules.org/name2structure.html )
smi_query <- "C1C2C(CCC1)CCC3C2CCC4C3CCC4"
# Remember: SMILES strings are valid SMARTS patterns
# steroids will be a vector of 0 and 1, with the compound IDs as names
steroids<- smartsSearchOB(sdfset,"C1C2C(CCC1)CCC3C2CCC4C3CCC4")
# you should get back 6 hits
table(steroids)
# check which molecules were found to contain this skeleton
which(steroids == 1)
# plot the first three answers to check (print=FALSE stops the printing of the SDF containers on the screen so that only the 2D structures and their names are printed)
# first select the steroid scaffold-containing molecules and then select the first three molecules in that list
plot(sdfset[which(steroids == 1)][1:3], print=FALSE) 

# Now we will carry out a substructure search using fmcsR
# For this, we need the query into sdf format
names(smi_query) <- c("steroid")
sdf_query <- smiles2sdf(smi_query)


# We will use the maximum common substructure search and limit
# the results to cases where the MCS is the same size as the query
# (au=bu=0 means that the upper bound for atom and bond mismatches is zero)
mcs_results <- fmcsBatch(sdf_query[1], sdfset, au=0, bu=0)
# fmcsBatch returns a matrix with the following colnames
colnames(mcs_results)
# extract molecules where the MCS size is equal to the size of the query
index<- which(mcs_results[,"MCS_Size"] ==17)
hits <- sdfset[index]
length(hits)
# check the first 4 hits
plot(hits[1:4], regenCoords=TRUE, print=FALSE) # Plots structures to R graphics device

# The R graphics representation of these compounds is not that great but hits
# can be visualised instead on the online viewer of Chemmine using
# the following command (which opens on a browser window). If you don't want
# to use the local browser (probably a good idea not to), copy and paste the
# web link you will get into a locally-running browser on your desktop/laptop.

sdf.visualize(hits)

# Finally, we can extract the MCS (=maximum common substructure) from a pairwise comparison and visualise it; # we select here two compounds from the sdfset as the result looks better
# the MCS will be coloured red in the molecular diagrams
# You may need to resize the plotting window to see the structures better.
plotMCS(fmcs(sdfset[[10]], sdfset[[100]], au=0, bu=0, matching.mode="aromatic")) 


```

### Generating and comparing fingerprints
Finally, we will look at fingerprint generation and comparison using ChemmineR
```{r fingerprints}
# First, we generate FP2 fingerprints using open babel's functionality
# FP2 are path-based fingeprints
fp2set <- fingerprintOB(sdfset, "FP2")
# check the first two entries
view(fp2set[1:2])
# compare all ligands to the first one (and return only the top 4)
# fpSim can take either FP or FPset of length one as input
fpSim.out <- fpSim(fp2set[1], fp2set, method="Tanimoto", cutoff=0.4, top=4) 
# the output is a vector with the compound ids as names
fpSim.out
# plot the results
plot(sdfset[names(fpSim.out)], regenCoords=TRUE, print=FALSE)
# or for better graphics:
sdf.visualize(sdfset[names(fpSim.out)])

# Next, we compute a whole matrix of similarities (all against all)
# for the same set of molecules
simMA <- sapply(cid(fp2set), function(x) fpSim(x=fp2set[x], fp2set, sorted=FALSE))
# we can check the similarity value of any two compounds in the matrix
simMA["CMP1", "CMP10"]
# or plot the distribuion of all similarity values
# first, reset the graphics device (you may not need to)
dev.off()
hist(simMA)
# We can also use R's clustering functions on the dissimilarity matrix
# below, we do hierarchical clustering using Ward's method agglomeration
hc <- hclust(as.dist(1-simMA), method="ward.D")
plot(as.dendrogram(hc), horiz=FALSE) 
# cut the tree into 10 clusters
groups<-cutree(hc, k=10)
# get the members of one of the clusters
groups[groups == 1]
# plot the structures of 4 compounds from clusters 2 and 3
plot(sdfset[names(groups[groups==2])[1:4]], regenCoords=TRUE, print=FALSE)
plot(sdfset[names(groups[groups==3])[1:4]], regenCoords=TRUE, print=FALSE)
# or visualising them online:
sdf.visualize(sdfset[names(groups[groups==2])[1:4]])
sdf.visualize(sdfset[names(groups[groups==3])[1:4]])

```
